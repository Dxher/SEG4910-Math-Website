# Problem Statement

Traditional math education often struggles to engage students and meet the needs of modern learners. Teachers also face challenges in adopting new technologies and teaching strategies. This project aims to bridge these gaps by creating an interactive, gamified educational platform to enhance math learning.

# Plan for Interaction
Biweekly virtual meetings to discuss progress, review prototypes, and gather feedback.  
Email and shared documentation for ongoing communication.  
Usability feedback from customers during development.  

# Project Description
This platform will combine math and games.  
Student Module: Engaging math quests aligned with the provincial curriculum. The player will answer math questions allowing them to gain in-game experience and rewards.  
Teacher Module: Oversee the quests, students, and progress.  
All educational content, including math quests, activities, and course materials, will be provided. Our role is to develop the technical infrastructure to deliver this content interactively and effectively.  

# Software
This project is a continuation of a previous capstone project. We have already spoken with Johanne and she stated that the previous year's students are going to give us a rundown of where they left the project off. The project will be a website. We have yet to know what languages and database providers they began with. 

# Engineering Challenges and Risks
Gamification Implementation: Ensuring features like leaderboards, rewards, and progress tracking are both functional and engaging.  
Scalability: Designing a platform capable of handling large numbers of concurrent users.  
User Experience (UX): Balancing simplicity and functionality to meet diverse user needs.  
User Roles: Ensure the teacher has as much control as possible.  
Security: Johanne stated her desire to prevent the illegal sharing of the website.  


# Mitigation Strategies
Utilize cloud-based infrastructure for scalability.  
Incorporate user feedback often during development.  
Weekly meetings with Johanne to make sure our progress aligns with the vision  

# Impact Analysis
Benefits:  
Enhanced student engagement and performance.  
Professional development for teachers.  
Opportunity to shape the future of math education.  

Liabilities:
Potential for technical issues disrupting user experience.  
Data security and privacy considerations.  

Relevant Standards/Legislation:  
Compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).  
Accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).  
Compliance with math curriculums.  

# Development Process
Methodology: Agile  
Sprint Planning: Biweekly iterations with specific goals.  
Scrum Meetings: Daily stand-ups to track progress.  
Retrospectives: Regular reviews to improve processes.  

# Evaluation Procedures
Quality Objectives:  
Seamless functionality of gamification features.  
Positive user feedback on ease of use.  
High platform uptime and reliability.  

Verification Methods:  
Usability testing with teachers and students.  
Formal code reviews and quality assurance checks.  
Stress testing to ensure scalability.  

# Schedule and Deliverables
Development Timeline:  
Week 1-2: Requirement gathering and system design.  
Week 3-6: Backend development.  
Week 7-10: Frontend development and UX optimization.  
Week 11-12: Testing, debugging, and final refinements.  
Week 13: Deployment and presentation.  
* The timeline will most likely be altered as we begin working on the project

# Math Learning Platform

We are embarking on an exciting journey to revolutionize math education through a unique, interactive platform. Our goal is to create a versatile, interactive platform that not only simplifies the teaching process but also embraces new pedagogical approaches for today's learners. This platform will feature engaging math quests aligned with the provincial curriculum for students and provide a series of innovative online courses for teachers. These courses are designed to equip educators with modern teaching strategies and effective ways to utilize our platform, ensuring they can meet the evolving needs of their students in this digital age.
